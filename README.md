# Challenge-1.io
Repo for week 1 challenge


In reviewing and revising the code in this website I ahve made changes to the semantics within the html and CSS, made changes to support logical structuring of the code, and made technical changes including fixing an on-page routing error in the nav bar. Below is a screenshot of the website to reflect its accuracy to the original screenshot.
